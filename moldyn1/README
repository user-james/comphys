This file outlines the methods and results of Assignment 1, where we look into the heat capacity of an fcc cluster.

The files compiled and ran as outlined in the file /home/users/PY4109/LJ_moldyn/README. Any changes to the files will be explained.

EXCERCISE 1:

In order to find the nearest neighbour atomic distances for the fcc cluster, the heat_capacity.c program was compiled and ran as outlined in the question.
Interatomic distances were written into the files 'pair_distribution_x' (where x is a number) along with the number of atomic pairs at that distance. 
Therefore to find the 'nearest-neighbour' distance, we looked at the first distances with a non-zero number at that distance. I looked at the file in
which the lowest temperature was simulated 'pair_distribution_0', this makes for a crystal with as little vibration as possible which would shorten the
interatomic distances.

The nearest distances found to be 1.09 (84 atoms), 1.10 (228 atoms) and 1.11 (24 atoms). Here I took a weighted average to return a single value for the
neartest interatomic distance. This evaluated to be ~1.098.

As a comparision the equilibrium distance between for a single atom in the LJ Potential was calculated by solving dV(r)/dt = 0 for r. This was found to 
be ~1.122.

Looking at these two values it's clear that atoms can fit closer together in equilibrium in a crystal structure than on their own in a LJ Potential. This
makes physical sense as a single atom in a crystal experiences external forces from all sides causing them to 'squeeze' tighter.

EXCERCISE 2:

In this excercise the aim is to calculate the heat capacity and the evaporation temperature of the fcc cluster.



(A) Heat Capacity (Low/High Temp):
In this case the file of interest is the 'output.txt'. Here we can find recorded values for the temperature at different energies. Plotting this graph
and taking the inverse of the slope should therefore yield the dimensionless heat capacity of the system. A graph plotting the data from output.txt can be found in 
'temp-vs-energy.pdf'

For the low temperature limit the first part of the graph was looked at and the slope was taken between the two points below the flattening region. The inverse of this value was 
then compared to the the value expected from the Dulong-Petit Law.

	- Dulong-Petit Law:		C = 3N = 3*79 = 279
	- Simulated:			C = 252.12

Although, these are not the exact same this simulation demonstrates the core idea behind the Dulong-Petit Law in that the heat capacity doesn't depend on
temperature. Looking at the plot in the file 'temp-vs-energy.pdf' this is clearly true for the low temperature limit of this fcc cluster simulation.


This procedure can similarly be carried out for the high temperature limit and compared to the ideal gas law. Again, the slope was taken between the two 'high-temp' points 
specified in the plot 'temp-vs-energy.pdf'. 

        - Ideal Gas Law:                C = 3N/2 = 118.5
        - Simulated:                    C = 120.13

Again we have a small numerical error but the temperature independence is clearly visible in the plot 'temp-vs-energy.pdf' for high temperatures as expected.



(B) Evaporation Temperature:
Here we changed the variable holding bounding the maximum temperature to allow the fcc cluster to evaporate. In the file heat_capacity.c the value of 
max_temp (line 38) from 0.05 to 0.25. The program was then run to simulate the heating of the cluster. Using the file 'output.txt' a curve was plotted 
called 'evaporation.pdf'. From this plot it can be seen that the curve flattens out; this is where the cluster is evaporating as it's temperature is
constant but it's energy is changing. As the 'flat' part of the graph is not actually flat, an average temperature was taken between the two points 
specified. 

The temperature (in scaled units) was found to be ~0.127. This was converted below for different gases:
	- He:	Sim. Temp -> 5.181K; 		Actual Temp. -> ~4K
	- Ne: 	Sim. Temp -> 18.133K;		Actual Temp. -> ~24.5K
	- Ar:	Sim. Temp -> 63.983K;		Actual Temp. -> ~83.8K

These temperatures are quite close but appear to diverge for larger atoms. This may be because the Lennard-Jones Potential is a simple model for use the
potential between neutral atoms. When heated, subatomic interactions may cause noticable unbalances in the charge denisty across an atom. This would have
a greater impact for larger atoms as there are is more charge to displace and so this may be the reason for the increased divergence of the boiling point 
for larger Noble Gases.

EXCERCISE 3:

The goal of this excercise was to see how the pair distribution varied with both temperature and for an uncorrelated fluid.



(A) Uncorrelated Fluid:
In order to simulate and uncorrelated fluid we changed the code so that instead of using a Lennard-Jones Potential there was no potential at all. This meant setting Fr = *Vint = 0 (lines 85/86 in 
forces_mirror.c). We then plotted the pair distribtion function for both the uncorrelated function and the standard fcc model we have been using up until this point on the same graph; these are 
found in the files 'fcc_fluid_compare_XXX.pdf' where XXX is the temperature they are compared at. As they are different systems the pair distributions were not written to file for the exact same 
temperatures so the temperatures they are plotted at are approximately the same.

In these plots a comparison of the pair distribution can be seen for different temperatures. For low temperatures the fcc cluster and uncorrelated fluid exhibit very different properties. Because the
interatomic forces fcc cluster are based on the LJ-Potential, they are less free to move. Therefore for low temperatures most of the atoms tend to be confined closer to each other than with for the 
fluid. Once the temperature is increased the atoms have more energy and so the potential 'matters less' as the atom can more easily escape it. Even for the second lowest temperature tested (T~0.115)
the atoms that are further away from each other appear to be far enough away that the potential is weak enough for them to approximate the uncorrelated fluid. 

Once the temperature is increased a lot, both systems have a very similar behaviour for atom pairs that are separated by quite a bit. However, due to the 'sharp' dip in the potential for small
distances, even for large temperatures the fcc cluster still has a higher proportion of the atoms at small distances. This is because the potential is very strong when atoms are close, but drops off 
quite rapidly for atoms that are far away.      

(B) Zero Temperature Cluster:
Due to large difference in y-axis scales for very low temperatures vs larger temperatures it is hard to compare these two systems on the same graph. However, looking at the file 'fcc_zerotemp.pdf' it
can clearly be seen that for a temperature of approximately zero the interatomic distances have discrete distances they can be from each other. Rather than a more continuous distribution that we 
have for larger temperatures (where atoms can be a range of distances apart), for approximately zero Kelvin there is so little motion that the atoms are very unlikely to have enough energy to escape 
the potential. Therefore they are confined to an equilibrium position so that their distances from other particles remains the constant.

EXCERCISE 4:

Here we want to simulate the difference changing the confining box to a limited potential has on the system. 


In order to simulate the potential well the function call to 'forces_m' was swapped with a call to 'forces' and the potential V0 was set to 0.05. The simulation was then run again as before.
NOTE: in the compilation of the 'heat_capacity.c' the file 'forces_mirror.c' is to be replaced with 'forces.c', as this is the file in which the function 'forces' was included.

We are interested in finding the heat capacity and so once the program finishes running, the output file 'output.txt' is what we are interested in. Using this file a plot of temperature vs energy 
for both systems were superimposed on each other in the file 'temp-vs-energy-compare.pdf'.

In the low temperature range the behvaiour is almost the exact same. This is because the particles have very little energy and so they are held close by the LJ-Potential and don't 'notice' the effect
of changing the external confinement because it's too far away.

During the period of evaporation their behaviour remains very similar until the very end of this period. From the graph is appears that the atoms confined to a box require less energy to evaporate
than those confined with a potential. In a box, the particles perfectly reflect off of the walls conserving their energy, however with a confining potential the atoms can escape and so there can be a
'leakage' of energy. Therefore, it makes sense that atoms confined to a box require less energy to heat to evaportion than those confined by a finite potential.
This effect is only noticed for relatively high temperatures (where the atoms have enough energy to noticeably interact with the potential) and so even after the evaporation period the effects are
still noticed. Above evaporation, the system confined to a box seems to have a higher heat capacity (slope inverse) than those confined to a potential. These are compared below.
    
    - Heat Capacity (Box):              C = 120.13
    - Heat Capacity (Potential):        C = 147.17

Again this makes sense at due to the fact that all particles in the 'box system' remain there making it less energetically expensive to increase the system's temperature.
