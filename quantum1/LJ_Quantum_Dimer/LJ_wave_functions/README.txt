This directory contains code required to numerically solve the radial Schrodinger equation on a non-uniform (shifted logarithmic) 
radial grid for the vibrational nuclear motion of a dimer with Lennard-Jones interaction between the atoms. 

   Radii are measured in units of the radius, r0, where the Lennard_Jones potential is zero. 
   The potential energy function is 4A (1/radius^12 - 1/radius^6). 
   The angular momentum (centrifugal) radial potential is l(l+1)/radius^2
   Thus, the energy is measured in units of hbar^2/(m r0^2), where m is the atomic mass for the atoms in the dimer. 
   The dimensionless parameter, A = e0 (m r0^2)/hbar^2, where -e0 is the minimum energy of the Lennard-Jones potential.

   The radial Schrodinger equation is equivalent to the 1-D equation for radius*wavefunction and is 
   solved using the finite-difference expansion for the grad^2 operator on a (shifted) non-uniform logarithmic grid,
   which is generated by the fortran routine 'grid' in the parent directory and then shifted radially outward by r_min.
   The boundary conditions are that the radius*wavefunction is zero at r=r_min and r=r_max.

PROGRAM:

LJ_wavefunctions.c
   This code is the main driver and should be compiled with ../grid.f and ../eispt.f in the parent directory
   with the command:
          gfortran LJ_wavefunctions.c  ../grid.f ../eispt.f  -o  LJ_wavefunctions
   to produce an executable file, 'LJ_wavefunctions'
   See header comments in this file for a more precise specification of the method.
