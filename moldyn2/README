This file outlines the methods and results of Assignment 1, where we look into the heat capacity of an fcc cluster.

The files compiled and ran as outlined in the file /home/users/PY4109/LJ_moldyn/README. Any changes to the files will be explained.

EXCERCISE 1:

The goal of this excercise was to compare the evolution of log derivative (defined f'/f, for a function f) from the simulation to that of a single particle in a Lennard-Jones (LJ) Potential. 

Important Files:
    - dynamical_matrix.c
    - equil_mode_frequencies
    - log_deriv_comp.py
    - l_deriv_comp.pdf

Methods:
    - The program './dynamical_matrix' was ran as outlined in the main /home/users/PY4109/LJ_moldyn/README. The output file 'equil_mode_frequencies' contains the frequencies and the log derivative 
    at that frequency in the 2nd and 3rd columns of this file.
    - The python program 'log_deriv_comp.py' was written to grab this data and plot it. This file also ran code to find the log derivative of the frequency with respect to displacement for a single 
    atom in a LJ-potential.
    - In the file 'l_deriv_comp.pdf', the simulated log derivative of the frequency was plotted against the frequency on one scale, while the same quantity but for the single atom was plotted against
    dispacement on another scale. Because the frequency increases with displacement, these two plots could still be compared with some rescaling.
    
Results:
    - In the plot it can be seen that both of the curves have a similar trend. The curve for the simulation is much more 'noisey' but this is to be expected.
    - The simulation simulates a cluster of atoms interacting via LJ-potentials and so there is bound to be more 'noise' as it involves complex interactions. However, the fact that it follows a 
    similar trend to the single particle in the LJ-potential is positive as it verifies that we can extract the general behaviour of the LJ-potential from this cluster.
    - Another point to note is that the graphs both appear to flatten out as frequency increases. This means that the log derivative approaches a constant which is the same as saying the derivative
    approaches a constant times itself i.e. f' ~ k f. This means that the frequency has an exponential form. For the single atom curve the log derivative is always negative, this means that the
    frequency must decay exponential with the displacement from equilibrium.

EXCERCISE 2:

The goal of this excercise is to study the distribution of the frequencies in the cluster.

Important Files:
    - dynamical_matrix.c
    - equil_mode_frequencies
    - log_deriv_comp.py
    - hist.py
    - freq_histogram_0.XX.pdf (0.XX is the width of the histgram bins)

Methods:
    - Using the python file 'hist.py' the distribution of the frequencies for the cluster was plotted. The file 'log_deriv_comp.py' was also modified to output the angular frequency of a single atom
    in a LJ-potential. 
    - In order to compare these values the angular frequency had to be scaled. The reason for this is that a cluster acts as a kind of group of coupled oscillators. The frequency of a coupled 
    oscillator is given by ang. freq. = sqrt(3*k/m) = sqrt(3)*(uncoupled ang.freq.). Therefore the value of the actual frequency (not angular) to be compared with the simulated frequency distribution
    was multiplied by root(3) and divided by 2*pi.

Results:
    - The frequency distribution was similar to a normal distribution, which makes sense as there was nothing in the model to prefer higher or lower frequencies.
    - Importantly, the distribution was centred near the expected frequency of a single atom in a LJ-potential (~1.04). Just like in excercise one we are able to extract the behaviour of the 
    LJ-potential from the more complicated cluster of atoms interacting vis this potential.

EXCERCISE 3:
    
The goal of this excercise is to study the eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix.

Important Files:
    - dynamical_matrix.c
    - e_values.txt

Methods:
    - Here the code in dynamical_matrix.c had to be modified to output the values of the first 10 eigenvalues of the matrix to the file 'e_values.txt'.
    - The modifications can be found in lines 159-165.
    - Modified the code to output the first 20 eigenvalues just to get a better idea of any patterns emerging.

Results:
    - From 'e_values.txt' the first thing notices is that the atoms appear to vibrate with the same frequency in all directions (groups of 3 are equal). This makes sense as the atoms were displaced
    by a distance equal in all directions and so it would be expected that the resulting vibrations are equal in magnitude.
    - The first 3 eigenvalues refer to translational motion and are all zero. We would expect this because due to the symmetry of the cluster, the atoms oscillate symmetrically with no preference 
    in either the positive of negative direction. This means that all the oscillations cancel out to yield a final translation of zero. 
    - The next 3 eigenvalues refer to the rotational motion of the atom. I would have expected this to be zero, or small at least again for symmetrical reasons. These e-values are non-zero but 
    small in comparison to others, this is because although the vibrations are symmetric, the intial displacement that causes them is always in the same direction for x, y, z. This can cause a 
    torque to exist causing a small rotation of the cluster.

EXCERCISE 4:

The goal of this excercise is to compare the eigenvectors for different eigenvalues.

Important Files:
    - dynamical_matrix.c
    - e_vects.txt

Methods:
    - The file 'dynamical_matrix.c' was modified to print the eigenvectors of the dynamical matrix to the file 'e_vects.txt'
    - The modified code can be seen in lines 326-334 of 'dynamical_matrix.c'
    
Results:
    - It was very hard to distinguish patterns in the eigenvectors of the dynamical matrix as they are long. However, one thing that was noticed is the repitition of groups of 3 elements in 
    e-vectors with different e-values. Because these vectors show the position of particle, this means that for distinct frequencies particles ended up in the same position. This may signify that 
    there are only a discrete set of frequencies and their multiples that the atoms can vibrate at, therefore for different frequencies and atom can return to the same position. If there were a 
    continuum of frequencies, it would be very unlikely that there would be any particles that would end up in the same position having vibrated at separate (non multiple) frequencies.



Note: Sorry for the delay in submission, I sent an email about my README file being corrupted. I hope it wasn't an inconvenience.
