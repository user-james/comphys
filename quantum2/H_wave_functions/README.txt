This directory contains code required to numerically solve the radial Schrodinger equation on a logarithmic radial grid
for the Hydrogen atom. 

   The hydrogen potential energy function is -2/radius. 
   The angular momentum (centrifugal) radial potential is l(l+1)/radius^2
   Radii are measured in Bohr (atomic) units, where 1 Bohr = 0.0529 nm.
   Thus, energy is measured in Rydberg units = 13.606 eV. 

   The radial Schrodinger equation is equivalent to the 1-D equation for psi = radius*wavefunction and is 
   solved using the finite-difference expansion for the grad^2 operator on a non-uniform logarithmic grid,
   which is generated by the fortran routine 'grid' in the parent directory.
   The boundary conditions are that the radius*wavefunction is zero at r=0 and r=r_max.

PROGRAM:

H_wavefunctions.c
   This code is the main driver and should be compiled with ../eispt.f in the parent directory
   with the command:
          gfortran H_wavefunctions.c  ../grid.f ../eispt.f  -o  H_wavefunctions
   to produce an executable file, 'H_wavefunctions'
   See header comments in this file for a more precise specification of the method.
