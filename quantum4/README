This directory contains a single program harmonic_oscillator.c that computes 
everything needed for the assignment this week.

The data for each exercise can be found the appropriate directory
i.e. exercise 3 files ----> ex3/

Within the programs main function it executes commands to complete all three
exercises. All functions used are commented and explained. 

The program is written to ensure all files are written to the appropriate
exercise directory.

There is a function that tests the integration method for a standard Gaussian
and a Sine wave incorporated into the program. This is commented out in the 
main function by default but can easily be uncommented to test the integration
accuracy.

COMPILING:

In order to compile this program, you just need to run the command:


gcc harmonic_oscillator.c -o harmonic_oscillator -lm


The '-lm' option just ensures the required math packages are included here.
