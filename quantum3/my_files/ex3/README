This exercise required the modification of the He_atom_hartree.c code. 
Rather than modifying the original code I just made a copy named 'modified_hartree.c' and 
modified this code to prevent confusion.

COMPILING:

In order to compile this code run the following command:

gfortran ../../eispt.f ../../ex_corr.f ../../grid.f modified_hartree.c -o modified_hartree

RUNNING:

This code was modified to run the DFT algorithm already used in Q1 but this time the charge
density is found from a weighted average that looks like:

charge density = x*(this iterations contribution) + (1-x)*(previous iterations contribution)


The ratio x is passed into the function as an argument on the command line rather than user
input. This was solely so that I could easily call the program for different ratios from a 
Python program if needed.


Therefore, in order to run the code use the command:

./modified_hartree x       ---------> where x here is the ratio you want to use between 0-1


You can run it without a ratio by just running ./modified_hartree, in this case the ratio
will default to 1 (gives the same algorithm as Q1)
If you input a ratio outside the range 0-1 the program will default the ratio back to 1.

However, because of the functions used in the program if you enter a character or string
as the argument, the ratio will default to 0.
