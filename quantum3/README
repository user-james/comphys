This directory contains programs to be used in calculating the ground state of the Helium atom
using density functional theory (DFT).

PROGRAMS:

He_atom_hartree.c:
  This contains the main code, which solves the DFT equations by a self-consistent interative method.
  Also contains the function 'findiff' for solving the radial Schrodinger equation with the finite-difference method

grid.f:
   Generates a log-radial grid (called in main code)

ex_corr.f
  Calculates the exchange-correlation potential and energy density (called in main code)

eispt.f
  Some standard matrix diagonalization routines (called in function 'findiff' in He_atom_hartree.c

REFERENCES:

Phys. Rev. 23, 5048 by Perdew and Zunger [pdf file], gives the parameterization of the exchange-correlation potential.
